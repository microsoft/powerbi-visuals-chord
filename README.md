# Overview
This type of diagram visualizes the inter-relationships between entities. The connections between entities are used to display that they share something in common. This makes Chord Diagrams ideal for comparing the similarities within a dataset or between different groups of data.

Nodes are arranged around a circle, with the relationships between points connected to each other either through the use of arcs or BÃ©zier curves. Values are assigned to each connection, which is represented proportionally by the size of each arc.

Customize data colors, axis, labels and more.
